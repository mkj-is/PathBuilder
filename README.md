# PathBuilder

_Path builder_ is a complete function builder for lifting paths into the declarative SwiftUI world. This function can be used for elegant and short definition of paths. Missing documentation gaps in SwiftUI are filled in using the old but good CGMutablePath knowledge.

## Motivation

Just wanted to learn to implement function builders. And during playing with animated paths in SwiftUI found a perfect place to experiment.

## Requirements

- Xcode 11 or above
- Swift 5.1 or above
- iOS 13, macOS 10.15, watchOS 6.0, tvOS 13.0 or above

## Installation

Using Swift Package Manager in Xcode.

## Usage

### Examples

With _PathBuilder_ you can write this to draw a triangle:

```swift
Path {
    Move(to: CGPoint(x: 50, y: 50))
    Line(to: CGPoint(x: 100, y: 100))
    Line(to: CGPoint(x: 0, y: 100))
    Close()
}
```

Instead of longer version:

```swift
Path { p in
    p.move(to: CGPoint(x: 50, y: 50))
    p.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 100, y: 100))
    p.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: 0, y: 100))
    p.closeSubpath()
}
```

Drawing a Swift logo can be implemented like [this](Documentation/SwiftLogo.swift).

### Path components

There are many basic path components present. You can create a new one by conforming to the `PathComponent` protocol.

#### Elementary components

- *Arc* – Adds an arc of a circle to the path, specified with a radius and angles.
- *Close* – Closes and completes a subpath in a path.
- *Curve* – Adds a cubic Bézier curve to the path, with the specified end point and control points.
- *Ellipse* – Adds an ellipse that fits inside the specified rectangle.
- *Line* – Appends a straight line segment from the current point to the specified point.
- *Lines* – Adds a sequence of connected straight-line segments to the path.
- *Move* – Begins a new subpath at the specified point.
- *QuadCurve* – Adds a quadratic Bézier curve to the path, with the specified end point and control point.
- *Rect* – Adds a set of rectangular subpaths to the path.
- *RelativeArc* – Adds an arc of a circle to the path, specified with a radius and a difference in angle.
- *RoundedRect* – Adds a subpath to the path, in the shape of a rectangle with rounded corners.
- *TangentArc* – Adds an arc of a circle to the path, specified with a radius and two tangent lines.

#### Grouping components

- *Loop* – Appends components to path iterating over supplied sequence and building path for each element.
- *Subpath* – Groups and appends another subpath object to the path.
- *Transform* – Groups, transforms and appends another transformed subpath object to the path.
